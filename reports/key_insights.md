## COMPLETE OBSERVATIONS AND INSIGHTS:

1. Survival Overview:
- Overall survival rate was 38.4% (342 out of 891 passengers)
- This suggests the disaster had a high mortality rate

2. Gender Analysis:
- Females had a 74.2% survival rate vs males at 18.9%
- "Women and children first" evacuation protocol was clearly followed
- Gender was the strongest predictor of survival

3. Passenger Class Analysis:
- 1st class: 63.0% survival rate
- 2nd class: 47.3% survival rate
- 3rd class: 24.2% survival rate
- Clear class-based discrimination in rescue efforts

4. Age Analysis:
- Children (â‰¤12) had higher survival rates than adults
- Average age of survivors was slightly lower than non-survivors
- Age showed moderate correlation with survival

5. Family Size Analysis:
- Passengers traveling alone had lower survival rates (30.4%) than those with family (50.6%)
- Optimal family size for survival was 2-4 members
- Very large families (>4) had reduced survival chances

6. Fare Analysis:
- Higher fare correlated with better survival chances
- Fare was strongly correlated with passenger class
- Reflects socioeconomic status impact on 

7. Embarkation Analysis:
- Cherbourg (C) passengers had highest survival rate (55.4%)
- Southampton (S) passengers had lowest survival rate (33.7%)
- May reflect class distribution by embarkation port

8. Key Patterns:
- Intersection of gender and class: 1st class females had 96.8% survival rate
- 3rd class males had only 13.5% survival rate
- Children in higher classes had near-perfect survival rates

9. Missing Data Impact:
- Age missing for 19.9% of passengers - could affect analysis
- Cabin data missing for 77.1% - indicates incomplete records
- Embarked missing for only 0.2% - minimal impact\

10. Statistical Correlations:
- Strongest negative correlation: Pclass (-0.338)
- Strongest positive correlation: Fare (0.257)
- Gender coding would show strongest correlation if encoded numerically

This analysis reveals clear social hierarchies and evacuation protocols that determined survival on the Titanic, with gender, class, and age being the primary determining factors.
